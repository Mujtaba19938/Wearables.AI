          answer:
            "Our face shape analysis uses advanced facial recognition technology to identify key facial landmarks and calculate proportions. While it's highly accurate for most users, factors like lighting, camera angle, and facial obstructions (glasses, hair) can affect results. For best results, use good lighting and remove glasses.",
        },
        {
          question: "What face shapes does the app recognize?",
          answer:
            "Our app recognizes the five main face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, and diamond. Each shape has unique characteristics, and our algorithm analyzes facial proportions to determine which shape most closely matches your facial structure.",
        },

          question: "How does the AI determine my face shape?",
          answer:
            "Our AI uses computer vision to identify 68 key facial landmarks on your face. It then measures the ratios between these points, analyzing features like face length, jawline angle, cheekbone width, and forehead shape. These measurements are compared against established face shape profiles to determine your closest match.",

            "No. Your privacy is our priority. All facial analysis is performed directly on your device, and we do not store or transmit your facial images or biometric data. The app works offline once the models are loaded, and your data never leaves your device.",

        },
        {
          question: "Can I use the app offline?",
          answer:

            "If the app is having trouble detecting your face: 1) Ensure you're in a well-lit environment, 2) Remove any face coverings, glasses, or hair obscuring your face, 3) Position your face within the guide frame, 4) Try a different background for better contrast, and 5) Restart the app if the issue persists.",

          question: "Why is the analysis taking so long?",
          answer:
            "The first time you use the analyzer, it needs to download the AI models, which may take a moment depending on your connection. After that, analysis time depends on your device's processing power. Newer devices are typically faster. If it's consistently slow, try closing other apps to free up resources.",

            "For the best virtual try-on experience: 1) Ensure you're in good lighting, 2) Keep your face centered and still, 3) Make sure your device has sufficient processing power, 4) Try using a plain background, and 5) Update your browser to the latest version. If issues persist, try using a different device.",
