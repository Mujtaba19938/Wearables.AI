        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-300 mb-3 sm:mb-4">
          Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in

          <li>
            <strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These are used to recognize you when you return to our application.
            This enables us to personalize our content for you, such as remembering your preferences (for example, your

          Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the
          ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be
          personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.
